You may want to use a `Stack`. A `Stack` has two primary methods.
The first method will `push` an item onto the end of the`Stack`.
The second method will `pop` the last item off the `Stack`.
But you might want to consider one of the other methods to avoid
getting an `EmptyStackException`. See the [Stack class Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html)
for more information.
